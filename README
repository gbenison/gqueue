gqueue: Process jobs in a queue, with option to retry failures, 'n' at a time

Using
=====

Run `gqueue-setup` in your work directory.  Place jobs to run in the "IN"
directory.  Each job must be an executable.  Jobs will be run with no arguments
in the lexical order of their names.

In the work directory, you will find these files/directories:

  IN           -- jobs waiting to run
  RUNNING      -- jobs currently running
  DONE         -- jobs that succeeded
  FAILED       -- jobs that failed to succeed within the number of retries allowed
  log          -- the stdout and stderr streams from jobs
